Hooks
I : What's a TA
===================
* intro / credits
* Aim of the talk:
	- how to get the most out of a department
	- you could be a TAD or an AD, almost the same
* damned if i know!
	- Will Wright hook  ![WW photo]
- Litany of failed metaphors >> Ideally 2 or 3 images per section!
	* MacGuvyer ![MacGuvyer photo]
		- #resourceful
		- TA's love solving problems
			— we are usually self-selected
			— for stubborness and curiosity!
			— Its why we make good debuggers
			— Who ya gonna call?
		- But:
			- he's a loner >> hair jokes
			- we work with others 
	* segue: renaissance man >> ![Leonardo]
		- the "technical"  in technical art makes it sound like it's all engineering
		- Leonardo is a good example of the idea that you can do both
		- ![mona lisa]
			+ We all know he painted the mona lisa
		- ![tech drawing]
			+ But he was also an inventor and tinkerer.
			+ And he was entirely self taught, which is true for most TAs
		- This image works because we're crazy half-and-half hybrids
			+ we can talk to artists and to programmers;  #hybrid
			+ Sometimes, jack-of-all-trades-master-of-none
		- TA's work to bring art and engineering together
		- So, that's a good idea of what a TA does.. 
	* segue: But what about teamwork?   ![RPG image with mage, thief, fighter, cleric]
		- RPG quad
		- Emphasizes teamwork  #service
		- Engineering = Wizard.  The glass cannon
		- Design = Theif.  Leaves work up to everybody else
		- Art = Fighter.  In the trenches
		- TA = Cleric. The support class.
		- Good metaphor! but service means more than spamming heals
			— nobody likes playing as just a buff buddy
	* Segue: service != spamming heals!
		- ![ Downton abbey / Mr Carson] >> perfect image would use almost the same layout as rpg image
		- Service which knows its own domain very well.   #logistics
		- gives deference, but expects to be recognized for expertise
		- the core of that expertise is in logistics and planning
			+ making sure we take on achievable tasks
			+ making it easy to achieve those tasks.
		- is it sexy? not always
		- but it makes the sexy stuff possible	 	 
	* Seque:  I almost wanted to use that as the final image
		- partly because it's funny
		- But I realized, at long last, that I already had the right image
		- it's a T-Shirt you can order from tech-artists.org
		- And that sums it up:
			- TA = "making artists more productive"
			- The most precious resource in any production is creative #brain_cells
			- we make sure they don't get wasted on BS.
	* Summation:
		- TA is a complex role
		- But it has 4 major elements
			— #problem solving
			— #diplomacy
			— #service
			— #logistics / planning
		- next part of the talk is to talk about how to be an informed consumer of TA services.
		- Wrap up on building a good department.
 
 >>  As of "Leonardo 3", coming in at 12 mins.  Not bad.
	
II:  setting expectations
================================
* Segue : Being an informed consumer
	- The key goal of tech art is to make other peoples work easier
	- That's what you want from your TA department
	- This section of the talk is about how to be a good consumer
		+ Doesn't matter who runs the group
		+ or  what the TOE looks like
		+ what matters is how you uses the tech art resources.
	- I want to show you how to be an informed consumer of TA services.
*  #Strategy vs #tactics (PROCESS)  >> Probably needs a wrapup infographic
	- I'm going to divide TA up into two halves
		+ #Strategy
		+ #Tactics
	- you need both!
		- balance shifts over the course of the project
		- more strategy early, more tactics late
		- But both they are mutually reinforcing
		- And equally vital
— Strategy and tactics anecdotes:
	>> let me illustrate what I mean by #strategy
	* Bad example: Zipper level design process
		- it was not a process at all,  it was just the way things happened to get done
		- Hand built levels
		- Important data baked into UVs
		- Roads, blends done by hand.
		- 6-8 week turnaround time for significant changes
		- Compare counterstrike, where we could turn around the level in a day!
		- Bad strategy = Bad process = bad games!
	+ Bad example 2: Bungie lightmaps
		- sometimes the problem is not design or engineering:  
		- sometimes it's artists!
			- all the artists wanted exact control
			- But the reality was a fixed pie
			- Couldn't make them budge
		— result: a huge waste of time, energy, #braincells
			- Results indistinguishable from auto-mapping
			- probably cost $250,000 per year  (10% of c-o-e for 20ish artists & TA support)
			- More importantly, it affected art choices 
				+ less time to think 	
				+ risk aversion
			- There are times when great outcome is worth sacrificing for... but this was not one of them!
	* Good example of #strategy >> Screen shot series, this is probably 4 'slides'
		— State of decay 
			— has 16 square km
			— 40,000 objects placed in the world
			— And parkour-style movement
			— And a team of 20
		— Design wanted to hand-place the markup
			- it's fast and easy
			- we can tweak it!
			- They were thinking "next milestone", ie, tactics
		— I said no
			- I was thinking "next year": strategy
			- the data was unnatural.  What is an oriented line?
			- even if we did it once, we could never manage it
			- and we ended up rebuilding the world 2.5 times
			- We build the markup into the tools
		- End result: we shipped the game, and it more or less worked.
			+ not perfect. Some assets could not be reused
			+ needed work from art, TA and engineering
			+ But it made the game shippable w/ tiny team
			+ low cost in #brain_cells
		- #Strategy saves the day
	
— Strategy reprise:
	* Moral of all 3 stories:
		- picking the right battles is the key to a successful production
		- you need good strategy to preserve #braincells
		- Not everything can be highest quality
		- Not everything can be hand tweaked to a high gloss
		- Every artists knows this while working
			- do don't forget it when thinking about how the production is designed
		-  You should expect... no, demand! -- good strategic insights from your TAD 	
	* Side note: Strategy and organization
		-  Is TA a department or group?
		-  Personally I don't much care
			-  if you're in a situation where TOE is important, you're probably already in trouble
		-  However, heres one useful principle to keep in mind
			- You want the TAD in discussions where process is important!
				- new features
				- new workflows
				- scalability
			-  The key thing that matter is **making the team pay attention to artists time and how it is spent.**
			-  It it takes a title to do that, then great 	
	*  Segue: We haven't said much about tactics
		-  When I say tactics, you should hear "help" or "service"  #cleric
		-   tactics matters
			+  small improvements are the core of the bond between TA and Art
			+  show that problems are understood
			+  and artist time is valued
	* Tactics is the foundation of strategy
		- The reason the industry moved away from tools programmers and towards TAS is that TA have lived the life
			+ they know the needs
			+ they know the frustrations
			+ >> graphic? Maybe a pyramid with artist on top, TAs in the middle, tools programmers in the base?
			+ This is why it's so important that the TA department has production experience.
		-   People don't always see the big strategic savings, but they see the little things.
			+  Artists are very conservative
			+  Vulnerable to stockholm syndome
			+  Example: Arena Net animations
				- Everthing in one file??
				- And if you change something at the beginning, you have to move all subsequent keys????
				- And.... NO ONE COMPLAINED.
		* Moral of the Anet story:
			- artists don't always stick up for themselves
			- you need to get their trust to make lives better 
			-  So you need to invest in tactics - aka, investing in service - to protect the ability of the strategy side to deliver
		*  Good tactics is really simple:
			-  be friendly
			-  be knowledgeable
			-  be helpful
			-  be responsive
			-  You need to make sure your TA's do and don't retreat into their own little world.  Daily contacts are important!
	
	* So, how can you evaluate the tactics of your TA's?
		- Obviously, context specific
		- but here are some examples:
			- Does every crash generate an automatic email?
				- .. and do TA's respond?
			- Are tools released with testing and validation
				- .. or just dumped into a network share?
			- Do TA's know how to help?
				+ there are lots of forms
					+ Good person-to-person skills
					+ Asking good questions
					+ Prioritizing 
			- Do the TA's keep artists happy and productive
	+ Tactics reprise
		* Good tactics is all about service
			- saving #braincells 
			- keeping people happy and productive
		* The hardest task for TA's is balancing strategy and tactics
			- Strategy, like engineering, tends to take lots of time
			- tension between doing service and complex code
			- TA's need to resist temptation to vanish into the ether
				- constant contact is good for morale
				- constant contact gives TAs better knowledge of the problems
				- constant contact build political capital!
			- Should be as embedded as possible
			- Schedule, plan and work with #strategy and #tactics in mind
	 	 	  
III:  Crisis management
==================================
* Seque:  we've talked about the balance between #strategy and #tactics
	- The other big complicating factor in TA life is the balance between the planned and the unplanned.
	- As napoleon used to say, "No plan survives contact the enemy"
	- Good strats will fail. Good service will not magic away production crises
	- Surviving crises is a key part of TA
* production experience is _the_ key
	- can't help what you don't do
	- Good TA needs to be able to switch hit as a production artist
		- not the best, but pro-level
	- Ideally they have "lived the life"
	- You need this for two reasons
		- Can't do good tactics if you don't know the customers
		- Can't do good strategy if you don't know the way things are made
* Disaster preparedness
	- The main reason you need experiences is to avoid all the hidden minefields
	- A lot of development is unplanned
	- When things go bad, TA is the first line of defence
		+ time to rename files?
		+ time to track down budget over runs?
		+ time to change contents of hundreds of files?
		+ Call a TA!
* Important difference: Disaster prep vs lurching from one crisis to another  
	- production always involves crises
	- TA's should be there to do the worst cleanup work
	- **BUT** working this way all the time is a failure
		+ It's demoralizing for TAs
		+ It enables bad behavior in other departments
	- Wes G. anecdote
	+ You’ll lose good people if you give them awful work to do
		- true for artists too!
	- Like Normandy beach -sometimes you have to make a frontal assault
		- But if you do it every time you’ll be defeated
		- back reference to #strategy.
* disaster prep tips
	- flexible scheduling
	- open file formats
	- automation tools
	- asset tracking and metadata
	-
IV: Wrap
===========
*	Sum up
	-	TA is a complex role
	-	Short history, no easy models to use
	-	Boils down to a simple idea:
		+	TAs are there to make other people more productive
	-	Getting the most out of TA's
		+	Strategy and tactics
	-	Chaos management
		+	light on your feet
		+	Good drawer full of tools
		+	flexible scheduling	
*  QA

Delenda / notes
============================================================================


- When putting together a department, you need a mix of personalities and skills
* Some examples of different skills with the same title
	- Riggers
		+ subdivided into 'character riggers' and 'technical animators' and 'mocap specialists' and state-machine drivers
	- FX guys
		+ broad range between graphics programmers who write own shaders and particles to production artists
	- 
* Returning to the theme of "fluidity"
	- A good department is a mix of  mix of art and tech skills
		— not just scripters!
			- riggers should animate
			- scripters should use own tools
			- fx / shader wizards need to make art

	-  Getting the most out of your TAD:
		* Wargaming  (DIPLOMACY)
			* Going to engineers with requests gives them all the power to approve or disapprove
			* Going in with a plan lets you set the agenda
			* Get TAD in on the artistic side of the plan, pick technologies that support that
			* Then pad your request list a bit :)
			* There will still be pushback
			* but if you start with a plan, you’re negotiating, not begging.
		* Use your TAs to improve the process  (PROC VISION)
			* constantly look for bullshit
				* what wastes time?
				* what wastes effort?
			* Be on the lookout for stockholm syndrome
				* Arena example
				* Bungie example
				* When artists are too beaten down they don’t even see the pain any more
			* Invest in fixing the process, not bandaids
				* Zipper polygon example
			* Invest in automation, not human wave attacks
				* State of Decay vs Halo
				* Wes anecdote
				* You’ll lose good people if you give them awful work to do
					* true for artists too!
				* There will still alway be situations that need human judgement and eyeballs
					* Like Normandy beach -sometimes you have to make a frontal assault
					* But if you do it every time you’ll be defeated
		* Use your TA's as pioneers (RENAISSANCE MAN)
			- go in early
			- prototype the process
			- push back on engineers
			- validate the practicality
			- then commit the line guys	
		* Expect good service (BUTLER)
			- TA's are there to unblock
			- they need to perfect the art of doing that while not getting bogged down
				— public backlogs
				— good communication
				— effective support
				— fast responses
			- need lots of uptime!
		* Reminder: No human wave attacks!
			- There will be times when somebody has to take one for the team
			- But it that's all they do, you won't keep the smart ones very long
		* 
Gimmicks  (pick one):
================================================
* Super team
	- TA, AD, Engineering, Design as a super hero group
		— unique specialties
		— collaborative work
		— ego & friction
* Division of labor
	- specialization is good for productivity
	- but it also makes it hard to own things
	- pick what you need to own!
	- http://lbpost.com/images/addison/5630Parque/RiveraMural01.jpg
* Scotty / Enterprise bridge crew
	- The miracle worker
	- But ask for the right miracles!
* The circus
	- Ringling brothers invented logistics
	- Logistics is the key to modern war
		— You don't win by being brilliant
		— you don't win by being bloodthirsty
		— You win by having enough toilet paper
		— anecdotes:
			* Red River campaign: build the dam!
			* Beanstalk bridges
* The CIA
	- (supposed to be) responsible for knowing what's coming up
	- future tech
	- future games
		— Al complaining about me ruining games by going on about reflections
	- "In service" : TA serves art
		— But sometimes has it's own agenda
* Mr Carson
	- the faithful retainer
	- there to server, but also to guide
	- make sure things work out smoothly
* The Chimera
	- multiple heads on one body
	- hard to know what to do with it!
* Duct tape
	- Useful for evertyhing
	- Not very elegant
* Natty bumpo
	- the pathfinder
		— prototype ways to work
		— leave a trail for others to follow
	- loner?
* Memory Alpha... the keeper of the lore
	- who knows all the nooks and crannies
	- this is not just a feat of memory
		— memory works on connections
		— TAs remember because the know both the inputs and outputs
* Macguyver
	- improvisation
* Rejected metaphors
	- All of the above, with commentary and cross outs

=======================================================================
Themes:
* The waterline:
	* are you contributing? Or filling in for other people's mistakes
	* Don't put people below the waterline
		- it's cruel 
		- it's counterproductive: nothing get's better
		- 
* The great compromiser:
	* reconciling different needs and interests
	* need to know enough about both jobs to do them well

* "Watercolor"
	* Boundaries are fluid, hard to delimit
		- eg on State of Decay I designed the pipeline and also did production

* Renaissance man
	- Not just because you know multiple things
	- But also because you pioneer things
		— Ex: alberti and the history of perspective
			* discovered by tinkerers 
			* popularized by systematizers
			* revolutionized the way art was made
			* "tips and tricks"
			* Craft and Theory are complimentary
				Combining both opens new doors
				Being a “Renaissance Person” isn’t enough
				Multi-skilled people make cool discoveries….
				…but without a system, discoveries remain curiosities
				How do you liberate creative energies?
				Exploration followed by packaging
				Make the fruits of discovery available to the crafts-people

* process vision
	- Seeing making stuff as a system, not an act
		— identify time wasters
		— identify one-way gates
		— fight for short, straight pipelines
	- Negotiation does not work
		— "We just won't do that" is a lie
			* Phinney story
			* Moonrise story
	- What works is designing the process right
		— simple
		— flexible
		— as linear as possible
	- Example: level editing a shooter game
		— Socom vs TF2
* talent for abstraction
	- Learn to see the visually significant cues that other artists see
	- ... and translate them in to tech.
	- Example: de-construct an image for the audience
		— glancing highlights
		— direct, indirect, specular, ambient etc
		— see contours and gradients as functions
		— see blend modes, etc
	- Not about just knowing what knobs to pull
		— also knowing what to ask for
	- Example:
		— "carved out of soap"
		— translate into:
			* soft contours 
			* soft terminators
			* lots of mid tones
* tolerance for chaos
	- Some engineers are "just so" people
		— don't like the boat rocked
	- TAs are the opposite:
		— "Interrupt driven"
	- Have to be able to deal with sudden chaos
		— psychologically 
			* don't freak out
			* Ship sank? Build another!
			* example:
				- rebuilding hit boxes.
		— organizationally
			* good backlog
			* example:
				- good email reporting tools
		— technologically
			* good library of tricks up your sleeve
			* know how to use a roll of duct tape.
			* Example: Crytek files lib
* Good memory
	- Somebody has to remember how things work
		— development is not linear or routine
		— we don't usually know how to do half of it
		— we imrovise and move on 
		— god help us if we have to go back
	- It's likely to be the TA (see "memory alpha") who remembers
	- Documents fail
		— More tools, less  process!
		— More tools, less documentation
		— if it can be automatic, it should be
	
* Guilds, secrecy
	- medieval tradition
		— secretive
		— local
		— family based
		— inefficient!
	- renaissance
		— formal
		— literary
		— repeatable!
	- We constantly struggle between these two
		— guild life is actually kind of fun
		— it's tight, it's us-vs-them
		— it's also more secure
			* artists keeping secrets
		— But the open economy is vastly more efficient
			* cheaper
			* lower risk
			* no run-over-by-bus problem
				- 343 story
		— Moral Q: are we putting people out of a job?
			* No - if we could do it, so could somebody else
			* If we make things more streamlined we're making the people with us more valuable
* Innovation vs iteration
	- Regular artists work best in iteration
		— try, view, judge, tweak, repeat
	- TA's need to innovate
		— new ways to work
		— new ideas to look at
		— proof of concept
	- These are complementary, but appeal to different people
		— TA = easily bored
		— Artists = hard to make them stop
		— innovators create a new process
		— iterators make it sing
* Department or not?
	- I don't like departments
	- but they can be a necessary evil
		— engineers / designers don't always want to hear from artists
			* "Lazy artists" story
		— It helps if the whole company knows that somebody is there to speak for the process
	- OTOH the relationship between art and ta is special
		— if you're not close, it's not working
		— TA exists to make art more productive
==========================================================================

* TA Roles
	* Role, identity are fluid
	* depends on personalities and project needs:
		- ex 1 : Doug and I :  1 % tech and 99% tech
		- ex 2 : Paul: The keeper of secret knowledge
		- ex 3 : Graham, Wes G:  commander of the Kamikaze airforce
		- ex 4 : Jamie M: lone genius, off in the ether doing stuff.

	* diplomat
		* Get engineers, artists talking
			* translate requests into actionable items
	* pioneer
		* Figure out how an idea can be achieved
		* prototypes and proofs-of-concepts
		* Often very involved in planning, less so in late stage
	* troubleshooter
		* content debugging
		* tools debugging
		* now we need to fix these 900 files, who’s with me?
	* manager
		* Keeping other TAs working
		* usual schedule / manager stuff
			* interesting because TA work is very fragmented
			* “interrupt driven”
	* planner:
		* how do we make this?
		* how do we make this _efficiently_
		* What’s going to bite us in the ass?
	* Tools dev:
		* fight for more creativity and less bs
		* fight for focusing on important stuff
			* saving button clicks is useful
			* saving wasted days is critical
	* Nanny
		* Explaining the mysteries
		* reassuring nervous artists
		* Engineers are right - its often user error
			* but if they make a system where errors are easy its their fault, not the artists’
	* Butler
		* Be there when called
		* biggest difference between engineers and tas!

Getting the most out of your TAD:

	* TA’s can be insecure:
		* Renaissance man? Or just bad programmer — bad artist?
	* Help them by setting high standards
		* Expect:
			* Good process vision 
			* Reliable tools
			* High quality service
	* Don't ghettoize
		- if you treat TA as a silo it's not able to do its job
	* look for people you can trust, then trust them
		* Don't use it as a dumping ground!
* Some companies don’t know what to do with TAs’
	* programmers don’t like people who know a little programming
	* Artists don’t like people with lesser art skills
	* If those prejudices lead to 343-style human wave tactics you’re in trouble.
		* Talented applicants will stay away
		* You’ll get more sad-sacks
		* self-fulfilling prophecy
	* You have a hand in building that group, and you should always be looking for quality
		* And keeping an eye on artists in house who would benefit from specializing
			* Scott story
